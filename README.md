# HarmonyBot
A basic, in-the-works Discord Bot for my private server using Discord.NET.
The bot is built using Discord.NET, as well as an incomplete but working StepManiaOnline profile parser built using the HTML Agility Pack.

To start the bot, you must edit Program.cs, line 29, and place your Discord bot application token
where I poorly commented "//token here". Leave the quotes.  

For StepMania, you need the UID that is presented at the end of a profile's URL
